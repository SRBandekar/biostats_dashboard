    "rsv_1": "The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) is a network that conducts active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations in children younger than 18 years of age and adults. The network currently includes 58 counties in 12 states, and data are collected and reported during the October 1-April 30 season each year. In some years, additional months of data are collected. In adults, RSV hospitalization tracking began in the 2016â€“2017 season. In children less than 18 years of age, surveillance began in the 2018â€“19 season. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. Hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospitalizations are subject to lag. Lag for RSV-NET case identification and reporting might increase around holidays or during periods of increased hospitalization utilization. Check the source link for the most updated dataset.",
